## Description

Partyhaus is designed to allow a group of people to collaboratively build and play a custom playlist. Using Spotify's API, users can request songs they want to hear while attending a party. These requests are then prioritized by popularity. The more a song is requested, the higher up it moves in the queue. This live playlist is then sent to the party host's phone and played through their Spotify account, removing the need for designated DJ. **This app is currently in development.**
